## üîç Project Overview

This is the second‚Äëassignment implementation for the Mobile & Web Development module. We built a single‚Äëcodebase web app where:

- **Students** log in to submit, search, filter, and vote on module‚Äëspecific questions.  
- **Staff** log in to view unanswered questions and post one or more answers per question.  
- All data (questions, answers, votes) persist in JSON files on the server.

   - Students: submit questions, vote, view questions.
